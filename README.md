Python for Beginners - Time rotating logs using logging.ini configuration

Real-world projects are meant to be well-structured and well-maintained.
Therefore, it is important to design your code architecture before starting to code.

Configs/:
In this project, you see the configs folder. This folder is meant to have all configuration-level settings.
Configuration helps in the development, deployment as well as in future planning.

If there is any kind of configuration level changes, we will just update the configuration file and restart the service.

logs/:
The logs folder will have all the logging of the project which includes, code flow, error tracking and keeping an eye when something goes wrong unexpectedly.
